# TurtlebotControl_Hugo

There are 3 version o the basic controller, they are updates of the of the previous ones as I advanced trough the tasks. Basic_controllerV2 and Basic_controllerV3
were both optmized to work with the double turtle in turtlesim, and can be lauched at the same time has turtlesim_node, using two_turtles.lauch

Basic_controller was done to work mainly with the lauch file test_controller.lauch 

All other files, are there mainly for testing reasons.
